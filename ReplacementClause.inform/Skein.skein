 Ah, it&apos;s so warm and cozy at home.  And today is Christmas Eve!  There will probably be tons of presents under the tree, and the food! The best food ever, roast beef, garlic mashed potatoes and gravy, how delicious.  Hey, what&apos;s up with this room?  This isn&apos;t my house, I don&apos;t have a fireplace, a lamp on the wall, or wooly carpet like this!  Ah, and why am I carrying a keyring and a letter?

An Interactive Fiction by Makana Tavepholjalern
Release 1 / Serial number 130317 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Home Room
 A beautifully old fashioned room with red brick walls.  The carpet is made of unbleached wool, and is soft and comforting to the touch.  There is a fireplace in the north facing wall.  The fire within the hearth is buringing merrily, and you can feel its gentle warmth.  Above it, there is a lamp hanging on the wall. Looking around, there is a gate to the west, a hardwood door to the south, a white door to the east, and an open door to the north through which you can smell roasting root vegitables.

You can see a White Door, a Hardwood Door, a Gate, a lamp and a Fireplace (in which is a Fire) here.

 The heat of the hearth in the home room is felt even here in the kitchen.  The walls are made of red brick, and there is a dinging table laden with food.  The east wall has some characters carved into the wall. 

You can see a front door and Dining table (on which are Beef Roast., Mashedpotatoes, Roasted turkey, Smoked ham, Green beans and Bread Pudding) here.

 A long room with a worktable stretching all the way down the middle.  This must be where all of the toys are made.  There is also a workbench, which is probably where the elves sit while they are doing their work.  On the eastern wall is a window looking out into the night. Way down in the corner is a big red bag, and sitting on the table right infront of you is a mini hammer.

On the Worktable is Mini Hammer.

You can also see a White Door and Toybag (empty) here.

Home Room
 A beautifully old fashioned room with red brick walls.  The carpet is made of unbleached wool, and is soft and comforting to the touch.  There is a fireplace in the north facing wall.  The fire within the hearth is buringing merrily, and you can feel its gentle warmth.  Above it, there is a lamp hanging on the wall. Looking around, there is a gate to the west, a hardwood door to the south, a white door to the east, and an open door to the north through which you can smell roasting root vegitables.

You can see a White Door, a Hardwood Door, a Gate and a Fireplace (in which is a Fire) here.

Santa&apos;s office
 So this is Santa&apos;s office.  As you walk into the room, you take notice of a strange machine bolted to the western wall.  This must be the Santa Transformer.  There is also a brown leather coat hanging on the wall and a window.

You can see a Hardwood Door and Coat here.

Kitchen
 The heat of the hearth in the home room is felt even here in the kitchen.  The walls are made of red brick, and there is a dinging table laden with food.  The east wall has some characters carved into the wall.  To the north is the front door of the house.

You can see a front door and Dining table (on which are Beef Roast., Mashedpotatoes, Roasted turkey, Smoked ham, Green beans and Bread Pudding) here.

 You are greeted by a cold blast of artic air, but you&apos;re mostly warm becasue of the coat you&apos;re wearing.  Your fingertips are freezing cold, so you shove them deep into your pockets; ah much better.  Ahead of you is the cold wasteland of the artic.  There is a blizzard going on outside, but through the thick drift of snow you can see a dark shape in the distance.
